# Web System Development Practice
**【Main Goal】**  
Create a basic web system, from Java project creation in Eclipse to building a JAR and getting it up and running on AWS.

Restrictions:
In order to improve debugging/researching skills, only a limited amount of assistance will be allowed for this project.
The only questions permitted are those pertaining to the project requirements.
The project must be uploaded to a public GitHub repository for inspection. Pushes to the repository must be relatively frequent (not once a week; ideally once a day or more).

**【Instructions】**  
1)	Read the list of development goals below.
2)	Estimate which goals can be reached within a week, and report those estimated goals to the Product Owner (“PO” – Connor).
3)	After confirming the week’s goals, spend the rest of the week developing the project, aiming to reach the designated goal.
4)	Check-in with the PO for a status update. 
5)	Repeat steps 2 - 4 until project has ended.

**【Sub Goals】**  
A)	Implement a barebones local web system (via JSF, JSP, Servlets, Tomcat, etc... Whatever gets the job done, your choice)  
B)	Login system with basic hard-coded credentials. The user will be taken to a login page upon accessing the site and must enter the hard-coded username and password to reach a welcome page. 2FA not required.  
C)	Database connection; logging in with DB (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc – your choice) user credentials  
D)	JAR build running on an AWS server (free tier)  
＊	Unit testing with ~100% coverage for all goal phases

**【Notes】**  
-	IDeale and other internal frameworks not permitted as the project will be uploaded to a public GitHub repository.
-	A free personal GitHub account/AWS account can be used to upload the code and JAR.
-	Be sure to notify the PO of the GitHub project’s public repository details so progress can be tracked.
